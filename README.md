## About

This project is an online simulator of a thrust control system (PID Controller) for a rocket.
The controller controls thrust of the rocket.
We presume, that the rocket can move only in the Y axis.
Goal of the simulation: the rocket should reach the destination height, starting from zero.

Simulation variables: PID controller constants (kP, kI, kD), time step, simulation time, max thrust (of the engine), destination height.

Used technologies: TypeScript, Next.js

The project runs online here: [srflp.github.io/pid-rocket](https://srflp.github.io/pid-rocket/)

## Getting Started

First, go into your "projects" directory.

Clone this repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/srflp/pid-rocket.git
# or if you use SSH key
git clone git@github.com:srflp/pid-rocket.git
# or GH CLI
gh repo clone srflp/pid-rocket
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
